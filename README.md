# Key-Value-File-System

# A key/value file system that utilizes raw and direct I/O operations on a block device. Can be run on a loop-back device. This implementation avoids reliance on kernel buffers for both reading and writing by incorporating efficient write buffering and read caching mechanisms to optimize performance.

#Usage
```
make
./cs238
```
